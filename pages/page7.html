          critical areas such as copyright law, marketing strategies, and
          digital publishing all essential for navigating today’s complex
          publishing landscape. Furthermore, with the rise of self-publishing
          and e-books, the college ensures students are well- versed in the
          latest digital tools. From mastering publishing software to
          understanding metadata and distribution channels, graduates leave

          design, where students explore typography, layout composition, and
          cover design. The program emphasizes the importance of visual
          storytelling, encouraging students to push creative boundaries while
          balancing aesthetics with readability. <br />In fact, students often
          collaborate across disciplines, working with writers and editors to
          produce complete publications. This holistic approach mirrors the
          real-world publishing process and fosters a deep appreciation for
          teamwork.
