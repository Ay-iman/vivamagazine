          If you walk through the vibrant corridors of Yaba College of
          Technology (YABATECH), you’ll notice a deep connection between
          tradition and innovation. From the walls of its historic printing
          studios to the buzzing digital design labs, this institution has
          played a groundbreaking role in book publishing and printing education
          in Nigeria. But how did it all begin? Let’s take a journey through
          time.

            >A Legacy of Printing Excellence (1952 - 1970s)</span
          ><br />
          Long before digital publishing and e-books, YABATECH was already
          setting the foundation for Nigeria’s book publishing industry. The
          journey began in 1952 with the establishment of the Department of
          Printing Technology—one of the ?rst of its kind in West Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally designed to train professionals for the booming print
          industry, the department focused on traditional printing techniques
          like letterpress, lithography, and bookbinding. Back then, students
          learned how to manually set type, ink presses, and produce
          high-quality printed materials—skills that were essential in an era
          dominated by newspapers, magazines, and physical books.
        </p>

            >The Digital Revolution & The Future of Publishing (2000s -
            Present)</span
          >
          <br />
          The 2000s brought the biggest shift in publishing since the invention
          of the printing press—digital technology. Traditional printing methods
          were being replaced by desktop publishing, digital printing, and
          online book distribution. YABATECH adapted swiftly, integrating Adobe
          In design, CorelDRAW, and digital publishing tools into its
          curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, students in the Department of Printing Technology are trained
          not just in o?set printing and book production, but also in
          e-publishing, interactive media, and 3D printing. The rise of
          self-publishing platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)
          and OkadaBooks has also in?uenced the program, ensuring graduates can
          compete in the fast-evolving digital publishing space.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep up with industry trends, YABATECH has formed partnerships with
          print and media companies, o?ering students internships and hands-on
          experience in book publishing, magazine production, and advertising.
          Why YABATECH Remains a Leader in Publishing Education
        </p>
        <p>
          Few institutions in Nigeria can boast of a 70-year legacy in book
          publishing and printing education like YABATECH. With its cutting-edge
          facilities, experienced faculty, and focus on both traditional and
          digital publishing, the school continues to be a training ground for
          the next generation of publishers, designers, and creative
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the next time you pick up a beautifully printed book or scroll
          through a digital magazine, there’s a good chance that a YABATECH
          graduate had a hand in its production. And with the rapid evolution of
          publishing technology, the future looks even brighter for this
          legendary institution. Want to be part of the next publishing
          revolution? YABATECH’s Printing Technology and Publishing programs
          o?er the perfect platform for anyone looking to make an impact in the
          world of books, media, and digital content. The story is still being
          written—are you ready to be a part of it?
